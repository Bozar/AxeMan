# Axe Man

> Axe Man, Axe Man, does whatever an axe can!

Axe Man is a Unity Roguelike game. You need to build four skills with "Lego blocks" and fight your way through the dungeon. The game is made with C# and Unity. The ☼masterful☼ tileset, `curses_vector`, is created by DragonDePlatino for [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161328.0). The color theme, `One Dark Pro`, is created by binaryify for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme).
